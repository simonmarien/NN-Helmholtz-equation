# NN-Helmholtz-equation
In this repository, we explored the process of reproducing the results of ‘A Neural Network with Plane Wave Activation for Helmholtz Equation’, published by Ziming Wang, Tao Cui, Xueshuang Xiang in 2020. The paper proposes a plane wave activation based neural network (PWNN) for solving the Helmholtz equation. In our reproduction, we focused on the comparison of the proposed PWNN model with a traditional activation based neural network (TANN) and a sin activation based neural network (SIREN).
